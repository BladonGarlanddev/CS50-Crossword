# What I learned

## AI
- I gained a strong understanding of constraint satisfaction problems
- I came to understand the backtrack algorithm and feel more comfortable with recursion
- I solidified my understanding of node and arc consistency
- I learned why the 'minimum remaining value heuristic' and 'least constraining value heuristic' are not contradictory and how they are beneficial to the algorithm

## Programming
- I learned to use the launch.json file while debugging to add arguments to the command that launches the program
- Embarrasingly, I learned the pop method
- I used square brackets next to a string to retrieve a letter for the first time
